		<h2>Internationalization</h2>
		<p>"International standard healthcare services", "leading international standard hospital", "international standard general hospital", "international standard one-stop service", these are all slogans you will find in hospitals throughout Asia and the East. Often these accompany the slogan of offering “patient centered care”</p>
        <p>We are often asked what international standard healthcare actually means, and to be frank there is no standard definition which is probably why so many hospitals like to use it for marketing!</p>
        <p>To bring some clarity to our clients we brought together all our decades of hospital management experience and define it as follows:</p>
        <p><i>When a hospital claims it is offering “international” standard care or services it is typically referring to either one, or a combination, of the following factors:</i></p>
            <ul class="style4">
                <li>Physical structure – providing a physical facility (rooms, depts, furnishings etc) that ‘look’ Western (or look like a hotel), and in some cases copying the structure (external/internal or both) of a famous hospital from the West.</li>
                <li>Staff – having staff who appear to be from the West, working in the facility; and/or having staff with qualifications from institutions in the West.</li>
                <li>Clinical – following best practice and/or having pathways defined by Western professional clinical associations; having multi-disciplinary teams; auditing by Western professionals of clinical practice</li>
                <li>Service – having the appearance of hotel style care e.g. hotel style reception, customer service, bell-hops, room service etc.</li>
                <li>Management – following Western hospital management systems such as DNV-GL, JCIA (vision, resources allocated, analysis, etc.)</li>
                <li>Risk Management – mitigating risk using Western style processes (business, IT, disaster etc.)</li>
            </ul>   
		<p>We can provide a pathway to the level of internationalization that you determine is suitable for your facility. Feel free to <a href="mailto:tweakmgt@outlook.com">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
